Pan Africanist idea first began to circulate in the mid - 19th  century in the USA, led by an African from Western Hemisphere called Edward Blyden. It was initially an anti - slavery & anti - colonial movement amongst black people of Africa & diaspora. It’s now a worldwide movement that aims to encourage & strengthens bonds of solidarity between all indigenous & diaspora ethnic groups of Africa decent.

Basically Pan Africanism can be said to have its origins in the struggle of African against enslavement & colonizations, & these struggles maybe traced back to the first resistance on slave ships - rebellion & suicides  - through the constant plantations & colonial uprisings & also the great back to Africa movement of the late 19th century by Marcus Garvey/Kwame Nkurumah.

Because it refers neither to a single political ideology nor a clearly discernible philosophical tradition, Pan Africanism is difficult to define. Many scholars avoid defining it, noting that its black internationalism & has varied drastically according to time & place. But Pan Africanism posits a sense of a shared historical fate for Africans in Americas, West Indies & on the continent itself, has centered on the Tran Atlantic Trade in slaves, African slavery & European imperialism.

Based on the belief that unity is vital to economic, social & political progress & aim to unify & uplifts people of African decent. The growth of the sentiment in the late 19th century can be seen as both the continuation of ethnic thinking & reaction to the limits of emancipation for former slaves in the diaspora & European colonial expansion in Africa.

Before the modern concepts of Pan Africanism, if not the term itself, dates from at least 1812 - 1885 an African American Martin Delany who developed his own re - emigration scheme after an expedition to Nigeria during 1861 & Edward Blyden adopted the slogan when he arrived in West Africa & played a significant role in the emergence of Pan Africanist ideas around the Atlantic through his public speeches & writings in Africa, Britain, USA & proposed we have an African personality resembling contemporary European cultural nationalism, which informed the notion of race consciousness developed by W.E.B. Dubois at the end of 19th century.

The slogan: Africa for the Africans! Popularized by Marcus Garvey’s declaration of Negro Rights in 1920 may have originated in West Africa.

Back -to- Africa movements - particularly the establishment of Sierra Leone by the British in 1787 & Liberia by American Colonization Society in 1816 significantly contributed to the emergence of Pan Africanism, & were probably the original source of the phrase - “Africa for Africans.

From 1808, English Evangelicals at CMS Grammar School in Freetown taught their liberated students that there were other Africans in captivity around the globe, which instilled a sense of a common destiny. Bringing many mission - educated Sierra Leoneans like the great Samuel Ajayi Crowther to move back to Africa, in some cases, moved back to Nigeria, primarily Lagos, where they are joined by returning freed people from Brazil & Caribbean. These groups quickly coalesced into the African upper class that produced the leaders of early nationalism & Pan Africanist leader like Herbert Macaulay the father of Nigeria nationalism.

Finally, Pan Africanism was the product of extraordinary, European - educated Africans & African - Americans. In other words, those most exposed to metropolitan culture & the influence of the modern world. The movement dedicated to establishing independence for Africa Nation & cultivating unity amongst black people throughout the world. It was originated in conferences held in London ( 1900, 1919, 1921, 1923) even before the World War II.

However, apart from the contributions of West Africa & African descendants in the New World, South Africa also developed a distinctive form of race consciousness then called Ethopianism. Up to the contemporary Rastafarian movement in Jamaica, the word Ethiopian has enjoyed a privilege position in Pan Africanist vocabulary as a term for all Africans.


The above history is a brief summary but you can broaden your scope by engaging in private self study of Pan Africanism to understand our struggles is not over.
