Pan-Africanist ideas first began to circulate in the mid - 19th  century in the USA, led by an African from the Western Hemisphere called Edward Blyden. It was initially an anti - slavery and anti - colonial movement amongst black people of Africa and the diaspora. It’s now a worldwide movement that aims to encourage and strengthen bonds of solidarity between all indigenous and diaspora ethnic groups of decent African.
<br><br>
Basically, Pan Africanism can be said to have its origins in the struggle of Africans against enslavement and colonization, and these struggles may be traced back to the first resistance to slave ships - rebellion and suicide  - through the constant plantations and colonial uprisings and also the great back to Africa movement of the late 19th century by Marcus Garvey/Kwame Nkurumah.
<br><br>
Because it refers neither to a single political ideology nor a clearly discernible philosophical tradition, Pan Africanism is difficult to define. Many scholars avoid defining it, noting that its black internationalism has varied drastically according to time and place. But Pan-Africanism posits a sense of a shared historical fate for Africans in the Americas, the West Indies and on the continent itself, has centered on the Trans Atlantic Trade in slaves, African slavery and European imperialism.
<br><br>
Based on the belief that unity is vital to economic, social and political progress and aim to unify and uplift people of African descent.The growth of sentiment in the late 19th century can be seen as both the continuation of ethnic thinking and reaction to the limits of emancipation for former slaves in the diaspora and European colonial expansion in Africa.
<br><br>
Before the modern concepts of Pan Africanism, if not the term itself, dates from at least 1812 - 1885, an African American, Martin Delany, who developed his own re - emigration scheme after an expedition to Nigeria during 1861, and Edward Blyden adopted the slogan when he arrived in West Africa and played a significant role in the emergence of Pan Africanist ideas around the Atlantic through his public speeches and writings in Africa, Britain, USA and proposed we have an African personality resembling contemporary European cultural nationalism, which informed the notion of race consciousness developed by W.E.B. Dubois at the end of 19th century.
<br><br>
The slogan: Africa for the Africans! Popularized by Marcus Garvey’s declaration of Negro Rights in 1920, it may have originated in West Africa. The back -to- Africa movements - particularly the establishment of Sierra Leone by the British in 1787 and Liberia by The American Colonization Society in 1816 significantly contributed to the emergence of Pan-Africanism, and were probably the original source of the phrase - “Africa for Africans.
<br><br>
From 1808, English Evangelicals at CMS Grammar School in Freetown taught their liberated students that there were other Africans in captivity around the globe, which instilled a sense of a common destiny. Bringing many mission - educated Sierra Leoneans like the great Samuel Ajayi Crowther to move back to Africa, in some cases, moved back to Nigeria, primarily Lagos, where they are joined by returning freed people from Brazil and Caribbean.
<br><br>
These groups quickly coalesced into the African upper class that produced the leaders of early nationalism and Pan Africanist leader like Herbert Macaulay, the father of Nigerian nationalism.
<br><br>
Finally, Pan-Africanism was the product of extraordinary, European - educated Africans and African - Americans. In other words, those most exposed to metropolitan culture and the influence of the modern world. The movement was dedicated to establishing independence for the African nation and cultivating unity amongst black people throughout the world. It was originated in conferences held in London ( 1900, 1919, 1921, 1923) even before World War II.
<br><br>
However, apart from the contributions of West Africa and African descendants in the New World, South Africa also developed a distinctive form of race consciousness then called Ethopianism. Up to the contemporary Rastafarian movement in Jamaica, the word Ethiopian has enjoyed a privileged position in the Pan-Africanist vocabulary as a term for all Africans. The above story is a brief summary, but you can broaden your scope by engaging in private self-study of Pan Africanism to understand our struggles is not yet over.<br><br>
