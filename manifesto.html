              Dear Fellow Nigerian Youths,
POLITICAL PROGRAMS TO BUILD A BRAND NEW NIGERIA
Now is our time to bind the wounds of division, youths have to get together. To all Igbo youths, Yorubas, Hausas, Fulanis, Ijaws and Kanuri youths across the nation. We say it’s time to come together as one united generation because we have been sitting down for so long looking at our country degenerate by failed old generational establishment leadership.

For those who have chosen to continue to support the Nigeria Plc establishment for this past 24 years of their kakistocracy, we are reaching out to you for your guidance and your help to build a New Nigeria Republic, unifying and saving our great country from failing.

The forgotten men and women of our great country will be forgotten no longer. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our country destiny and your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way to our freedom from this neocolonialist regime.

You have voted PDP or APC before, and it’s the-same failed outcome they have always delivered. So what do you have to loose, if you support us to help reclaim our country’s destiny and dream big and bold and daring because as a young Nigerian you basically don’t have anything to loose again. We have to do this together!

You all have given us such an incredible support and our work on this movement is now really just beginning. Our primary goal is to build a New Nigeria Republic founded on equity and justice.


Consequently, we have a plan for a brand new constitution that would be called the bottomline constitution. It would kickstart the New Nigeria Republic. You may feel the die is cast and that there is no way to choose an alternative path any longer. But a New Nigeria is always possible because the future is not written until we write it ourselves. And no, it is not too late to change the way all things are currently going.

But to do so, we must do so with conviction and conscious effort that we want better and not the same failed crop of political parties because our nation is now a youths canvas and the New Nigeria Project is our masterpiece.

On 12th June, 2023 we will declare a New Nigeria Republic together by replacing the current corrupt 1999 Marxist Military Socialist Constitutions with the original constitutional script of the USA founding fathers as our base foundation to formulate the Bottomline Constitution that will radically reduce the size, scope and reach of the Federal Government.
