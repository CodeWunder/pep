Politics is basically a science that’s why it’s been taught in the faculty of social science to focus on theories & practices of government at local, state, national & international level. There are several legal set of institutions that constitutes a government called political system.

The four most popular are: Democracy - government where the people select their government
                                               Monarchy - government by a king usually kingdoms over the people
                                               Oligarchs - government by few elitist people with authority over the people
                                               Authoritarian - government with absolute authority over the people

However, all four political systems can be classified into two distinct layman terms: Ruler - these are elite people most time who believe that they are entitled to power over their masses who are classified as Ruled.

Politics is a social science that is basically about power sharing & money is the major motivating factor of any power sharing ideology anywhere in the world or in any of the above listed political system practiced around the world. Consequently, we cannot understand political science without the basic knowledge of money.

Money is a medium or means of exchange which could be either trading of goods or services this is why the Bible said “ money answers to all things, but the love of money is the root of all evil”. Which brings this fundamental question, is money a good thing or an evil thing?

Since money is derived from either goods or services, who are those who can make money - worker provides services & earns a salary or a trader sells her goods & makes a profit in money terms as simple as that.

For example a country sovereignty is likened to a geographical estate of land, people & resources; & government is basically like an estate management company receiving service charges instead of taxes. Government is ran by taxpayers money & public servants are citizens in form of politicians applying to to do these jobs for the people under an estate management company platform, which is preferred to be called a political party.

Political party is an organized group of people who share similar ideas about the way in which government should operate & the people in a political party are politically aligned at similar point on the political spectrum.

We started our education with  definition that several legal set of institutions constitutes a government is called political system & so when they say democracy it simply mean a political system where power is basically shared through an electoral process given to the people to choose their government. However, political spectrum is basically the economic ideology that help us identify our political position on how we believe government ought to be operated.

Finally, politics derived its fundamental foundations on two basic economic systems  called socialism & capitalism. Socialism is called the leftist ideology while capitalism is on the right wing ideology. However, leftist spectrum believes in state control of government & right wingers believe in individual control of government, others now claim centrist because they believe in blending state & individuals control together.

But it should be noted that RAP is a libertarian ideological party with conservatives ideology believe meaning rightist because we are Africans & we need to protect our traditions first.
