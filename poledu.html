No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them. Nobody is going to teach you your true history, teach you your true heroes if they know that that knowledge will help set you free,” - Assata Shakur, a revolutionary political educator.
<br><br>
Education is power, and the power of knowledge can drastically change perspectives and ways of living. I can truthfully say that my way of seeing things has changed after taking my education into my own hands.
<br><br>
There is a mixture of things that should make up a sound political education: literature, economics, history, service and abolition. So politics in itself is basically a science. That’s why it’s been taught in the faculty of social science to focus on theories and practices of government at the local, state, national and international level; and there are several legal set of institutions that constitute a government, called a political system.
<br><br>
The four most popular are:<br>
Democracy - government where the people select their government.<br>
Monarchy - government by a king usually kingdoms over the people<br>
Oligarchs - government by few elitist people with authority over the people<br>
Authoritarian - government with absolute authority over the people<br>
<br>
However, every political system can be classified into two distinct layman terms: RULERS - these are elite people who most time believe that they are entitled to power over the masses who are classified as the RULED.

Politics is a social science that is basically about power sharing, and money is the major motivating factor for any power-sharing formula or ideology anywhere in this world or in any of the above listed four political systems practiced around the world.
<br><br>
Consequently, we cannot understand the science of politics without the basic economic knowledge of money. Money is a medium or a means of exchange, which could be either through trading of goods or services.
<br><br>
This is why the Bible said “money answereth to all things, but the love of money is the root of all evil”. Which brings us into this fundamental question: is money a good thing or an evil thing? Since money is derived from either goods or services, who are those who can make money? - workers provide services and earn a salary or a business trader sells her goods and makes a profit in money terms as simple as that.

So when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing, or when you see that money only flow to those who deal, not in goods or services but favors; nor when you see men get rich through taxpayers' money than by work and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect them against you. Or when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice. You should automatically know that socialism is imbedded in such economic and political system.

A government is a group of people who officially control a country and a country is an area of land that has its own government, army, etc. For example, a country's sovereignty could be likened to a geographical estate of land, people and resources; and government can also basically be likened to an estate management company running an estate through service charges instead of taxes, just the way a government functions.

Government is run by taxpayers' money and public servants are citizens in form of politicians applying to do these jobs for their people, just like under an estate management company platform, which is preferred to be called a political party.

Political party is an organized group of people who share similar ideas about the way in which the government should operate and the people in a political party are politically aligned at a similar point on the political spectrum.

We started our education with the definition that several legal set of institutions constitutes a government is called a political system and so when they say democracy, they simply mean a political system where power is basically shared through an electoral process given to the people to choose their government.

However, the political spectrum is basically the economic ideology that helps us identify our political position on how we believe government ought to be operated.

Finally, because money and power sharing goes hand -in- hand. Politics derived its fundamental principles from two basic economic systems called socialism and capitalism.

Socialism is an economic and political system in which a country’s trade and industry are owned or controlled by the government as a whole. While capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.

Socialism is called the leftist political spectrum, while capitalism is the rightist political spectrum. However, leftist believes in state control of government and rightist believe in individual control of government. Some others now claim to be centrist because they believe in blending state and individuals control together.

But it should be noted that RAP is a libertarian ideological party with conservatives ideological values because we are Africans and we need to protect our traditions first. So we don’t judge our political calculus by whether a person is good or evil… qualified or not, rather we simplify it to whether they are a socialist or a capitalist because these are the only party ideology that governs politics and the way governments functions on the earth.
